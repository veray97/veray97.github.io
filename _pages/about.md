# **About Me**
Hi, I'm Jialei Yang! I am currently a Quantitative Financial Analyst in BECU, a credit union. 

I received my Master's degree in Computational Finance and Risk Management from University of Washington in March 2022. Before that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Finance from CUFE(Central University of Finance and Economics) in June 2019.

I used Cursor to write a time-management project called [Forget Me Not](https://verasdatabase.web.app). It uses Four Horizons method to manage time. If you download the app, it can also have reminders on Mac or iPhone.

In my leisure time, I'm a big fan of HIKING!
